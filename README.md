# Best_WWF_Words

This takes in an array representing a current scrabble board and a list representing tiles in your hand and returns the highest scoring moves for that round.

WWF_wordscores_cleaned.ipynb is the working notebook.

WWFImageProcessor.ipynb is me playing around with image processing, attempting to transform a WWF screenshot into an array representation.
